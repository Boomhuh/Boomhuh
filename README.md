## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Rachit this side!
I am a student in 9th grade who is looking forward to teach myself and keep up with the numerous technological advancements that have been going on. I want to make the most of my time hence I have been using my account for the working and launching of the codes that I do. When I was you younger I was interested in playing Minecraft a lot and hence had taken help from my mates in making a bot for it, old stuff haha! Now, as I am growing older I want to learn as many programming languages I can and you know, just have fun with it! :)
